    <center> <h2> In this project, an apple tree and backdrop is drawn. The user is then asked to choose an amount, from one to six, and a size, small or large, for the apples. The program draws the apples, giving them a randomized color of red, gold, or yellow green. Afterwards, the user is given a prompt to start the apple drop, causing the apples to fall from the tree and bounce off the hill. </h2> </center>
